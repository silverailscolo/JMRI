    <h1>OpenLCB: RR-CirKits Tower LCC+Q STL Editor</h1>

      <p>The <strong>Tower LCC+Q</strong> node from RR-CirKits has the same I/O capabilities as the
      original Tower LCC. The logic Conditionals have been replaced by a subset of the PLC
      (programmable logic controller) language from Siemens.  The Siemens statement line language
      (STL) is a high performance language with a small memory requirement.</p>

      <p>Here is the logic to set the aspect for a single head mast.</p>

      <pre style="margin-left: 2em">
CLR // Right B
= Q0.0
= Q0.1
= Q0.2
O I0.4
O I0.5
O I1.1
= Q0.2
JC E1
A Y0.0
= Q0.1
JC E1
= Q0.0
E1: CLR // Right C
etc.
      </pre>

      <p>The STL logic is based  on item states instead of item change events. LCC events are
      collected
      in the input table (I) variables. The logic is processed every 20 ms with the true/false
      results set in the output table (Q) variables.  At the end of the cycle, the LCC events for
      <strong><em>changed</em></strong> output variables are sent to the LCC network.</p>

      <p>The <strong>STL Editor</strong> consists of a LCC node selector, five data tabs, a number
      of toolbar buttons and <strong>File</strong> and <strong>View</strong> menus. The basic mode
      is to select a LCC node which loads the logic data.  The node selector only shows Tower LCC+Q
      nodes.  When changes have been made, they can be stored using the <a href="#storeButton">Store</a>
      button.</p>

      <p>Offline work is supported by exporting and importing the content using a CSV file set. This
      is a set of five files stored in a selected directory in the user files location.  Each
      Tower LCC+Q node will need its own directory.</p>

      <p>The online and offline modes can be used together.  For example, select the node which
      loads the data.  After making changes, export to CSV for a backup.  Then do a store and
      compile.  Later some offline changes are made and exported.  To get them back to the node,
      select the node which loads the old data.  Do the import to overwrite the old data and then do
      the store and compile.</p>

      <p>The <strong>STL Editor</strong> has been added to the OpenLCB/LCC menu.</p>

       <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <a href="images/lcc_menu.png"><img src=
        "images/lcc_menu.png" alt="stl openLCB/lcc menu"></a>
      </div>

      <h3>Node Selector</h3>

      <p>The node selector lists the available Tower LCC+Q boards.  Other LCC nodes are not shown.
      When a node is selected, the logic content will be loaded.  If this is the first time the node
      has been selected during the PanelPro session, the load takes a long time.  A dialog is shown
      while the load process is working.</p>

       <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <a href="images/cdi_loading.png"><img src=
        "images/cdi_loading.png" alt="stl cdi loading"></a>
      </div>

      <p>When the load finishes, the dialog will close.  If the node had been previously loaded,
      such as doing CDI configuration, the load is very fast and the dialog is not shown.</p>

      <h3>STL Editor</h3>
      <p>The STL Editor provides an alternative method for editing the STL code.  It translates the
      code into a table that has 4 columns.  The <strong>Label</strong> column has the jump labels.
      These are one to four character words and a colon (:).  The <strong>Operator</strong>
      column contains a drop down with all of the PLC operators.  The <strong>Name</strong> column
      contains names.  This will have the user friendly name if one was defined in the IQYZ (input,
      output, receiver, transmitter) tables. Other "names" include labels for jump operators, timer
      definitions, Mn.n memory variables, etc. The <strong>Comment</strong> column is for comments.
      Note:  Comments take up a lot of room.</p>

      <div class="noted">

        <p>The friendly names assigned to the IQYZ tables would normally be the JMRI user names.
        There are some limitations.  The names in the IQ tables have to be unique.  This
        also applies to the names in YZ tables. For example, a JMRI sensor button with the user name
        "Turnout 1" (I table) is used to set a JMRI turnout also with the user name "Turnout 1" (Q
        table). A possible solution is to use "T-Turnout 1" as the Q table name.  For signal mast
        aspects in the Q table, using a colon between the mast name and the aspect works nicely.
        For example, mastname:Clear.</p>

        <p>Note: The friendly names are only used for documentation in the CDI and by the STL Editor
        to map names to the IQYZ table entries. There is no direct relationship to the actual JMRI
        table names.</p>

        <p>There are few reserved names in STL.  One of them is the timer variable.  This is the
        letter <strong>T</strong> followed by a number from 0 to 63.  Using this as a IQYZ name or
        in a comment will cause issues.  For example, don't create a comment such as
        "Set T1 closed".</p>

      </div>

      <p><span class="since">since 5.9.6</span>A friendly name from the IQYZ tables can be copied
      using a <strong>shift-click</strong> on a table row.  Hold the shift key and then click on a
      table row.  The name field in the logic table will be added/replaced.  Make sure the correct
      logic row has been selected before doing the copy from a table row.</p>

        <a href="images/editor_tab.png"><img src=
        "images/editor_tab.png" alt="stl editor tab"></a>
      </div>

      <p>The program code is stored in the node. There are 16 logic groups.  Each group has a 255
      byte space. The percent button is used to calculate the current space utilization.</p>

      <p>The Label data is validated to make sure that it has the proper format.</p>

        "images/label_format_error.png" alt="stl label error"></a>
      </div>

      <h3>Logic Inputs (I)</h3>

      <p>The Logic Inputs table has 128 entries.  They are numbered from 0.0 to 15.7 (16x8).  If
      names have been assigned to the rows, then the editor will translate between the
      <strong>In.n</strong> variable name and the user friendly name.  Each row has two event ids.
      The first one is the event that the logic treats as true and the second for the event that is
      treated as false.  The user has to decide what is true and what is false.  In the image,
      thrown turnouts and active sensors are true.  From a logic point of view, think of "is it
      thrown?" and "is it occupied?".</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <a href="images/input_tab.png"><img src=
        "images/input_tab.png" alt="stl input tab"></a>
      </div>

      <p>The event id format is validated for the IQYZ tables.  Note: Dialog removed as of JMRI 5.11.4</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <a href="images/event_format_error.png"><img src=
        "images/event_format_error.png" alt="stl event error"></a>
      </div>

      <h3>Logic Outputs (Q)</h3>

      <p>The Logic Output table has 128 entries.  They are numbered from 0.0 to 15.7 (16x8).  If
      names have been assigned to the rows, then the editor will translate between the
      <strong>Qn.n</strong> variable name and the user friendly name.  Each row has two event ids.
      The first one is the event that the will be sent when the variable has changed to true and the
      second for the event that will be sent when the variable has changed to false. The output
      events are only sent when the variable state changes between true and false.</p>

      <p>In this image, the output events are signal aspects.  The aspect will be sent when the
      variable changes to true. The sample PLC code at the beginning of this page shows 3 aspects
      being set to false.  The subsequent logic will set one of them true. The net result is that
      <strong><em>at most</em></strong> one aspect will change from true to false and one will
      change from false to true.  Most of the time, one variable will be set to false and then back
      to true.  Only an occupancy change, turnout change or destination mast change (link speed)
      will result in two variables changing. The aspect false events use a zeros event with the
      aspect id in the last two bytes.</p>

       <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <a href="images/output_tab.png"><img src=
        "images/output_tab.png" alt="stl output tab"></a>
      </div>

      <h3>Track Receivers (Y)</h3>

      <p>The Track Receivers table has 16 entries. The Signal LCC <strong>Rule to Aspect</strong> has
      a <strong>Link Address</strong> for each mast, such as 02.01.57.10.01.6B.01.80. The link
      address is a node specific value and cannot be changed. The link address has to be copied and
      pasted from the Signal LCC.</p>

      <p>In the Signal LCC, each mast <strong>Rule</strong> is assigned a track speed value.  The
      default is Stop (0).  These values translate to a number from 0 through 7.  This number
      replaces the last digit of the link address when the aspect changes.</p>

      <p>The actual receiver variable names consist of the row number and the speed number, such as
      <strong>Y0.7</strong>.  That is the "Clear" speed for the first circuit.  For the STL Editor,
      the <strong>Yn.n</strong> names are converted to the friendly name with a tilde and the speed
      number, such as <em>SM-Alpha-Beta-1:Circuit~7</em>.</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <a href="images/receivers_tab.png"><img src=
        "images/receivers_tab.png" alt="stl receivers tab"></a>
      </div>

      <h3>Track Transmitters (Z)</h3>

      <p>The Track Transmitters table has 16 entries.  Each entry will contain the link event id.
      The link event ids are node specific and cannot be changed.</p>

      <p>Each Track Transmitter maps to 8 aspect/speed settings.  These are 0 through 7.  This
      results in <strong>Zn.n</strong> variable names.  To represent this as a user friendly name,
      the STL editor name is <strong>name~n</strong>.  The tilde character is the separator
      between the row name and the aspect/speed number.</p>

        <dd>
          <p>When an event name is available, the name will displayed instead of the event id.</p>

          <p>When updating an event column row, the event id or the event name can be used if one
          is available.  If an event id is entered and it has an event name, the event name will be
          displayed.  A dialog is displayed when an invalid event id or a bad event name is entered.</p>

          </div>

          <p class="noted"> The STL Editor does not support assigning a name to an event.  Other
          LCC tools provide this capability.</p>

        <dt>Loading a CDI backup file</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Older CDI backup files can have an event name instead of an event id.  The load process
          will use the event name to find the current event id.  If the event name no longer exists
          in the "name store", a temporary event id will be created.  The format of the event id
          is <strong>00.00.00.00.00.AA.BB.CC</strong>.  AA will be hex value of the table type. These
          are IQYZ.  The BB and CC hex values will the table group and items.  The I and Q tables have
          16 (0-15) groups and 8 (0-7) items per group.  The Y and Z tables have 16 (0-15) rows and
          a single item that is always zero.  A dialog will be displayed when a temporary event id
          is created.</p>
