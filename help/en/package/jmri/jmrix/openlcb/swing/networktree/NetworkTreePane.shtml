      <h1>OpenLCB: Browse Configuration</h1>

      <p>The "Configure Nodes" OpenLCB tool lets you directly see the nodes on your OpenLCB network
      and do some back manipulations on them. It works with your OpenLCB installation to gather the
      information you need as you run the tool; there are no local configuration files in your
      computer.</p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>When you first open the tool window, it shows a tree of accessible OpenLCB nodes. For
          most installations, this is just the list of what's attached via a CAN adapter.</td>
          <td>
            <a href="StartWindow.png"><img src="StartWindow.png" width="113" height="71" alt=
            "Starting image"></a>
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>You can click to open each node and see more about it.</td>
          <td>
            <a href="OpenNodeInfo.png"><img src="OpenNodeInfo.png" width="112" height="120" alt=
            "After click to open"></a>
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>Opening the "Supported Protocols" item, for example, will show you the capabilities
          of that particular node.</td>
          <td>
            <a href="OpenProtocol.png"><img src="OpenProtocol.png" width="159" height="179" alt=
            "After open protocols"></a>
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr  id="CDItool">
          <td>If you click on the "CDI" item, for Configuration Description Information, you'll get
          a DecoderPro-like configuration tool for the node. 
          Note that this is entirely taken from
          the OpenLCB node itself. There's no need to find a decoder configuration file, select the
          right board type, etc.
          <p>
          The top section is identification information from the selected node
          that shows the manufacturer, model and version information.
          <p>
          Below that is user-configurable information.
          </td>
          <td>
            <a href="StartConfigWindow.png"><img src="StartConfigWindow.png" width="254" height=
            "406" alt="Initial configuration window"></a>
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr id="configure">
          <td>You can fill those fields out and click "Write" to configure the node. 
          The top few fields are
          used to give it a user-chosen name and description, so you can remember this node later.
          You can set the events that correspond to different inputs and outputs, and even give
          those user-convenient names. That's all stored permanently in the node.
          <p>
          At the bottom are some additional buttons:
          <ul>
            <li>Refresh All - reads all the values from the node, over-writing
                any changes you may have made
            <li>Save Changes - writes any changed values to the node.  This is 
                equivalent to pressing the "Write" buttons that are next to the changed fields.
                If there are no changes, this button is disabled.
            <li>Backup... - stores the node's configuration information to a file
                on your computer
            <li>Restore... - reloads the configuration from a previously-created
                backup file.  Note that this just changes the values in the window;
                you have to click "Save Changes" to store them to the node.
            <li>More.. - additional options specific to the capabilities of the node.
          </ul>
          <p>
          As you change values, you'll notice the background on some type of items and tabs
          change from white to orange.  Orange indicates that you've changed a
          value and should write it to the node so it's not lost. If you enter
          an invalid value, such as an integer value that's too large or too
          small for that particular item, the background will turn to blue.
          You can see the valid range for each integer value by hovering your
          mouse cursor over it. A tooltip will pop up showing the 
          correct range of values. You can also press the Refresh button to 
          reload the current value from the node.
          <p>
          Some replicated sections will appear as tabs.  You can copy
          and paste all the values in a section between tabs using the usual ctrl-C/cmd-C and 
          ctrl-V/cmd-V keys on your keyboard.  You can then click "Write" or "Save Changes"
          to set those values in the node.
