      <h1>LCC Traffic Monitor Window</h1>
      JMRI provides a communications monitor window so you can see what's happening on the
      LCC network.
      <p>
      <img src="MonitorPane.png" height="419" width="977" alt="Traffic Monitor Window"/>
      <p>Once you open a monitor window, it will automatically display all traffic on the network as
      long as "Filter Bytes" is blank.</p>

      <h2>Controls</h2>

      <dl>
        <dt>Copy to clipboard</dt>

        <dd>Copies the log area to the system clipboard.</dd>

        <dt>Clear Screen</dt>

        <dd>Erases the log area at the top of the screen.</dd>

        <dt>Freeze Screen</dt>

        <dd>Stops acquiring new information, so that the captured information stops scrolling
        up.</dd>

        <dt>Show raw data</dt>

        <dd>Normally, the monitor displays the program's interpretation of what it's seeing. If you
        want to see the raw bytes, check this box.</dd>

        <dt>Show timestamps</dt>

        <dd>Normally, the program just displays the data from the communication link. If you'd like
        each message to be preceded by the time it was sent or received, check this box.</dd>

        <dt>Window always on top</dt>
        <dd>This window will stay on top of other ones as you move windows around.</dd>
        
        <dt>Auto scroll</dt>
        <dd>Scroll the contents of the window up so that the most recent traffic is 
        visible at the bottom.  If you manually scroll the window, e.g. to look at 
        something, the auto-scroll will pause until you bring the window back down to the bottom.</dd>
        
        <dt>Show Name for Node</dt>
        <dd>Display node names in addition to their numeric IDs.  This takes an extra
        line on the display, so we make it optional.</dd>
        
        <dt>Event (First)</dt>
        <dd>Event IDs can have name and navigation information associated with them.
        When this box is checked, only the first of those will be displayed.
        This takes less space on the display than showing them all.</dd>

        <dt>Event (All)</dt>
        <dd>Show all the information that's associated with an event ID.
        </dd>
        
        <dt>Filter Bytes</dt>

        <dd>You can filter unwanted messages from the window by entering each message's first hex
        value(s) into the "Filter Bytes" field. This can be especially helpful when there is a lot of
        routine comm traffic. Separate multiple values by spaces. e.g. "195B4 19544". This example
        will suppress any messages whose raw data starts with "195B4" or "19544". You can determine
        the appropriate hex values by turning on "Show raw data."</dd>

        <dt>Add to Log</dt>

        <dd>If you want to insert a message into the captured information, e.g. to make a note
        about what you're about to do, you can type it into the text field next to the "Add
        Message" button and then click that button. This is particularly useful when you're logging
        to a file (see below) and want to make a note for later about what's happening.</dd>
      </dl>

      <h2>Logging To A File</h2>
      Sometimes, it's helpful to capture what's happening. For example, you might encounter a bug
      (!!), and want to send a copy of what's happening to the people who are trying to fix it.
      <p>Small amounts of data can be copied from the log window with your computers "copy" command
      (e.g. ctrl-C or cmd-C), and then pasted into an email.</p>

      <p>If you want to capture more, you can have the window write a log file on your computer's
      disk. To do this:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Click "Choose log file". A file-chooser window will open. Navigate to where you want to
        store the file, enter a name for the new log file, and click "Save". Note that if you pick
        a file that already exists, it will be overwritten.</li>

        <li>When you're ready to capture the data you want, click "Start logging" on the monitor
        window.</li>

        <li>When you're done, click "Stop logging" to store the data and close the file.</li>
      </ol>
      
        <h2>Interpreting the Output</h2>
        
        A simple message with all options on might be listed like:
<code><pre>
17:49:57.335: [[19968a90] 03 19                  ]  S: 02.01.12.FE.77.16 - 09.00.99.03.00.35 Identify Events 
  Src: JMRI - LccPro    Dest: TCS CS-105, S/N 0035
</pre></code>

        Interpreting this from left to right:
        <ul>
        <li>"17:49:57.335" is the local time that the message was processed
        <li>"<code>[[19968a90] 03 19                  ]</code>" is the contents of the
            CAN frame that was received in this case.
        <li>"S:" indicates this was sent by JMRI; R: indicates it was received by JMRI
        <li>"02.01.12.FE.77.16" is the node ID of the sending node, in this case JMRI
        <li>"09.00.99.03.00.35" is the node ID of the destination node.  If this is a 
                global message, this will be blank
        <li>"Identify Events" is the interpretation of the message.  This field might be quite long.
        <li>On the next line, "Src: JMRI - LccPro " is the name of the source node.
        <li>"Dest: TCS CS-105, S/N 0035" is the name of the destination node.
        </ul>
        
        Messages that carry event IDs may have extra lines to carry additional information
        about the event.
