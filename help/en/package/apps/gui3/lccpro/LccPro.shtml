      <p>
      LccPro is a 
      <a href="../../../../html/apps/index.shtml">JMRI application</a>
      that focuses on configuring your LCC network.
      </p>

      <img src="LccProMainWindow.png" 
        class="floatRight" height="251" width="472" alt="LccPro main window"></a>

      <p>
      The main LccPro window is a table showing all the LCC nodes on your network.
      Each row shows information about a single LCC node.
      If the node supports it, there are "Configure" and "Upgrade"
      buttons that will open functional windows for 
      <a href="../../../jmri/jmrix/openlcb/swing/networktree/NetworkTreePane.shtml#configure">configuring the node</a>
      and 
      <a href="../../../jmri/jmrix/openlcb/swing/downloader/LoaderFrame.shtml">upgrading its firmware</a>
      respectively.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      When you select a row, more information about that node is shown
      on the lower left. The node's list of supported LCC protocols is
      shown in the bottom-center panel.  You can resize those bottom
      panels using the slider bars between them, and open or close them
      using the small disclosure triangles on the slider bars.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      In the bottom right is a search field.  Start typing there
      and LccPro will select the first row in the table with a matching
      name.  As you continue typing, this will narrow down to finally
      matching just the right entry. The search ignores the lower vs upper case.
      


      <p><span class="since">Since <a href="http://jmri.org/releasenotes/jmri5.11.2.shtml">JMRI 5.11.2</a></span>
      <a name="nodegroups" id="nodegroups">
      Below that is a selection box that will let you display "(All)"
      nodes or just ones that you've entered into a specific "Node Group".
      To add or remove nodes from a group, use the popup menu (right-click or ctrl-click)
      on the node's row in the main table.  You can also use the
      node groups you've defined here to specify what should be visible in the
      <a href="../../../jmri/jmrix/openlcb/swing/eventtable/EventTablePane.shtml">Event Table</a>.
      <p>
      Across the top is a tear-off set of buttons that will open
      other LCC tools, including 
      <ul>
        <li>The
            <a href="../../../jmri/jmrix/openlcb/swing/eventtable/EventTablePane.shtml">Event Table</a>
        <li>The
            <a href="../../../jmri/jmrix/AbstractMonFrame.shtml">LCC Traffic Monitor</a>
        <li>The
            <a href="../../../jmri/jmrix/openlcb/swing/stleditor/StlEditorPane.shtml">STL Editor</a>
      </ul>
      It also includes a "Refresh" button that will reload the table
      and a "Help" button that will bring you to this page.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      At the bottom of the window is a status bar containing the name of the currently
      configured connection, and an indicator of whether that LCC connection
      is currently active with traffic or not.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Because LccPro is a work in progress, the lower right region is not populated yet.  
      <a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">Suggestions</a> 
      about what to put there would be appreciated!
